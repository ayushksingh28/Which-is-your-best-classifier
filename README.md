# Which-is-your-best-classifier

This repository contains a Python script developed by Ayush Kumar Singh that helps you determine the best classifier for your machine learning task. It provides a comparison of various classifiers based on their performance metrics.
The is built on Stremlit to provide an introduction to the features and workings of Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushksingh28/Which-is-your-best-classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Which-is-your-best-classifier
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For Unix or Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by following the required format as mentioned in the script's documentation.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python classifier.py
   ```

3. The script will perform the classification task using multiple classifiers and display the performance metrics for each classifier.

## Available Classifiers

The script currently supports the following classifiers:

- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


You can add or modify the classifiers in the script based on your requirements.
